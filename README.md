**Project Management**

Project management (PM) is a well-defined discipline with a thriving professional association, Project Management Institution (PMI). In addition, many higher education courses are available that provide certification programs. The methods, tools, and best practices can provide significant depth for any type of project. It is important to select the areas that best support your project and the culture of the organization.

It is recommended that you do not take a one size fits all approach; instead, use the following tools and techniques that will ensure success:
- Detailed Project Plan
- Schedule and Work Breakdown Structure
- Change Control
- Communication Plan
- Risk Register and Issue List


**Business Analysis**

Business analysis (BA) is often overlooked, primarily because the assumption is that ‘everyone knows what we do’. The fact is most departments within an organization don’t really know at a granular level how things actually get done within other departments. Over time most teams, departments, and workgroups adopt ‘workarounds’ to address issues they cannot get others in the organization to address. The BA role focuses on interacting with department managers and operational subject matter experts (SME) to understand exactly what the daily workflow process is.

An effective business analyst has a keen understanding of technical issues and software. In short, the business analyst is the person that can speak the language of business and technology in a fluid and easy to understand manner. This role must effectively provide written descriptions of business process and be a strong technical writer. An effective business analyst should possess the following attributes:
- Ability to whiteboard as-is and to-be process improvement
- Use story boards to engage and identify with users
- Possess strong interpersonal and presentation skills
- Maintain strong peer support


**Project Deliverables**

Project deliverables should be broken down into discrete components of the original scope of work (SOW) description. The key difference between a SOW and deliverables in a project plan is the level of detail. It is recommended that the detailed project plan be authored as a collaborative effort, making sure that all key stakeholders take ownership. Key deliverables include:
- Project deliverable descriptions
- Assumptions made and dependencies
- Responsibilities for Departments / IT / External resources
- Risks including description, consequences, likelihood of occurrence, and mitigation
- Acceptance criteria


**Acceptance Testing**

Acceptance testing is usually the final stage before releasing the product. This stage usually involves some client-side users who test a set of agreed upon acceptance criteria. These acceptance tests should be decided upon during requirement analysis, and later can be updated during the development or testing phases.
Although the testers already execute the user acceptance tests before even reaching this stage, it is usually considered as a final verification by the end users before the ECM solution goes live.

It is important that these tests include credible scenarios of interacting with the system. When designing these tests, it is essential to incorporate feedback from domain experts and end users of the system. The tests usually include detailed, step-by-step instruction on how to execute the test scenarios in simple language. It is important that the people executing the user acceptance tests are selected from the actual end users, if possible.

Setting up a test environment is also an important task. Although sometimes it may not be possible to use the exact system infrastructure, a mock or demo infrastructure should be set up that incorporates the crucial subsystems and dependencies.

### Module 3

ECM is a Solution that supports practices and methodologies implemented with SharePoint technology.

The key areas any ECM solution must address are:

- Storage - logical locatin of the file
- Process - entire lifecycle of content
- Governance - legal and business continuity
  * Single source of truth
  * Security
  * Versioning
  * Rights management
  * Retention policies
